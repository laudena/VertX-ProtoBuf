# Vert.x-ProtoBuf
Testing protocol buffers with VertX [JAVA]

__Vert.x__ is a tool-kit for building reactive applications on the JVM.
__Protocol Buffers__ are a language-neutral, platform-neutral extensible mechanism for serializing structured data.

This sample deploys two verticles that transfer a simple object between them. The data is encoded using protocol buffers, and it is sent using the vert.x event-bus.

___HelloRequest___ holds is a sample class with single property: name

___HelloWorldProto___ is auto-generated by protoc.exe 4.3.0, from the proto file _Simple.proto_

___SpeakerVerticle___ generates a HelloRequest object and convert it into message using protocol buffers generated _HelloWorldProto.HelloRequest.Build_

___ListenerVerticle___ receives the message through vert.x's event-bus and convert is instantiate an object based on the message received.


Target folder holds executables compiled for Java8 on Win7. For Windows, batch files are available: _build-verticles.bat_ and _run-verticles.bat_
